# House Price Prediction

This project utilizes TensorFlow to implement a Random Forest model for predicting house prices. The focus is on building the model and front-end interface for visualizing predictions.

# Data Description 

[Link Text]('data_description.txt')

## 1.Data Collection:

Gather a dataset containing historical house prices and relevant features from Kaggle Dataset.


## 2.Data Preprocessing:

-> Handle missing values, normalize numerical features, and encode categorical variables.
-> Split the dataset into training and testing sets.

## 3.Model Training

-> Initialize a Random Forest model using TensorFlow.
-> Train the model on the training dataset, adjusting hyperparameters for optimal performance.

## 4.Prediction

Use the trained Random Forest model to predict house prices for new data.
